# mZip
Multiple Zip Extractor

Just add the <b>.python</b> and <b>.bat</b> file to your <b>system32</b> to simply use it.<br>
Now you just have to jump into a <b>cmd</b> and type : 
<br><code>mZip "Path To Directory containing zip files"</code><br>
You don't need to have only zip files in the directory, the file not ending by .zip will be skipped.
